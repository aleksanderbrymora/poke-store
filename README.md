## Description

This project is a small thing to get me started with working with few cool technologies:

- Recoil
- React Suspense
- Typescript in react
- Custom hooks

## Instructions

To run it you must have [json-graphql-server](https://github.com/marmelab/json-graphql-server) installed globally.
